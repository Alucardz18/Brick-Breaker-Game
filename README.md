# :video_game: Brick-Breaker-Game
A simple Brick Breaker game built in Java. Players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks while earning points. 
The game includes different brick rows with point values, colors, and masks that determine how the bricks are displayed.
The project focuses on modular code structure with separate classes for game profiles, brick rows, the paddle, ball, and main loop. 
This makes it easy to extend the game (new levels, power-ups, scoring rules, etc.) while keeping the codebase organized.

# :package: Features
- Paddle and ball mechanics
- Multiple brick rows with customizable colors and point values
- Score tracking
- Object-oriented design (separated into classes like GameProfile, BrickRow, etc.)
- Expandable for adding new levels, power-ups, and difficulty settings

# :bulb: Future Improvements
- Add levels with increasing difficulty
- Add power-ups (multi-ball, larger paddle, etc.)
- Add sound effects and graphics
- Add lives system and game over screen
